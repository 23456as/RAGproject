## 📘 Overview

RAGproject is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, combining state-of-the-art natural language processing and information retrieval techniques. This project showcases how to leverage large language models with external knowledge bases, delivering AI-powered responses grounded in factual sources.

## 🚀 Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:**  
  Answers are produced using relevant documents retrieved from a knowledge base, enhancing accuracy.

- **Modular Pipeline:**  
  Easily adaptable components for retrieval, generation, and evaluation.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  Simple input/output handling for seamless interactions.

- **Clean Architecture:**  
  Designed for clarity, maintainability, and extensibility.

## 📚 Technologies Used

> This project leverages the following languages, frameworks, and tools:
- **Python** — Core logic, AI components, orchestration
- **Git & GitHub** — Version control, collaboration
- **Jupyter Notebook** — Experimentation and prototyping (if included)
- **Other Libraries:** Typically includes `transformers`, `langchain`, `faiss`, etc.  
  _Refer to `requirements.txt` for full dependencies._

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Query Input:**  
   User enters a question in natural language.

2. **Document Retrieval:**  
   The system fetches relevant documents from a pre-built knowledge base (can be text files, PDFs, Wikipedia, etc.).

3. **Response Generation:**  
   An AI model (like GPT, BERT, etc.) generates a contextual answer using both retrieval results and language understanding.

4. **Output:**  
   The answer is displayed, with supporting sources optionally included.

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/23456as/RAGproject.git
    cd RAGproject
    ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
   _Or, if using notebooks:_
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook RAGproject.ipynb
    ```
